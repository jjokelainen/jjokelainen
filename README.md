### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an embedded software developer specializing in IoT devices with experience in Bluetooth Low Energy, 4G and lora connections. Additionally, I have worked as a full-stack developer using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript and I am proficient in Python for R&D tool development.
 
On the lighter side, I'm also a casual Unity3D enthusiast. 
I find the prototyping process on game development to be particularly rewarding - there's nothing quite like watching an idea take shape!
I'm always committed to honing my skills as a software developer, and I'm excited to connect with others who share the same passion.
