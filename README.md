### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
I consider myself a versatile software developer with a wide range of skills and experience.  
Though my official title is "embedded software developer," I'm not one to shy away from new challenges.  
In fact, I thrive on them! I love to dive into new technologies and explore their possibilities.  
Here are just a few areas where I excel:
* Cloud Services: I'm familiar with various cloud service platforms and how to integrate them into software applications.
* Full Stack Development: I've worked with nodejs/Express, react, and typescript to develop efficient, user-friendly web applications.
* R&D Tool Development: I've developed several tools using Python, which have greatly streamlined the R&D process.
 
On the lighter side, I'm also a casual Unity3D enthusiast. When I'm not coding for work, I enjoy creating productivity tools for my personal use. 
I find the prototyping process on game development to be particularly rewarding - there's nothing quite like watching an idea take shape!
